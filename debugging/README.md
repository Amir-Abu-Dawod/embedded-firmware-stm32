# Fault Analysis & Debugging

This directory focuses on diagnosing firmware failures at the register and stack level.

Focus areas:
- HardFault, MemManage, BusFault, UsageFault analysis
- Extracting stacked registers on exception entry
- Identifying root causes of crashes
- Using OpenOCD and GDB for low-level inspection
- Fixing linker and startup-related faults

Faults are treated as debugging opportunities to understand system behavior more deeply.
