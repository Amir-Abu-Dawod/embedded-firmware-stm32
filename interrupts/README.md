# Interrupts & Exception Handling

This directory contains experiments related to the ARM Cortex-M exception model and NVIC configuration.

Focus areas:
- NVIC register configuration
- Interrupt priorities and preemption
- Exception entry and exit sequence
- IRQ handler implementation
- System exceptions (SVC, PendSV)
- Fault handlers (HardFault, MemManage, BusFault, UsageFault)

Emphasis is placed on analyzing stacked registers and understanding exception behavior at the architectural level.
