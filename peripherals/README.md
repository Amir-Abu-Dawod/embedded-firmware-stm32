# Register-Level Peripheral Access

This directory contains experiments accessing STM32 peripherals directly via memory-mapped registers.

Focus areas:
- GPIO configuration
- Timer configuration
- Direct register manipulation
- Bitwise control and peripheral initialization

All interactions are performed without HAL abstractions to reinforce datasheet-driven development.
